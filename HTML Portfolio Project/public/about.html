  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm on a journey of discovery, learning who and what I want to be as a programmer and web developer.</p>
  <p>I began this journey in April 2024, desperate for a more powerful outlet for my creative ideas and desires and decided to take the first step on a self-taught journey of grand discovery. </p>
  <p>I hope you too, dear reader, will appreciate the journey as much as I do as I document and record each step along the way -- each project a mere capstone, leading me toward my ultimate destination.</p>
